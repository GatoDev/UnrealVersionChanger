# Unreal Version Changer
I was too lazy to download the whole engine just to download 25 MB plugin, that weren't upgraded to next UE version. So here it is.

Simple tool for faking UE version for Epic Games Store so we can install outdated / non-upgraded plugins to newer UE version without installing old UE

## WARNING!
I did my best to prevent corrupting Epic Games Store files data, the tool will save every file before modifying it in **EpicGamesBackup** directory next to **main.pyw** file. if you get stuck with broken EGS data, just restore files from backup.

## How to use
- Download [latest release](https://github.com/Gradess2019/UnrealVersionChanger/releases/latest)
- Open main.pyw
- Select your current UE version that will be modified
- Type the preferred UE version
- Press **Change**
